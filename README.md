# Negative Chemical Data Boosts Language Models in Reaction Outcome Prediction
Code for learning chemical reactions from negative chemical data with language models and reinforcement learning.

The repository includes instructions to replicate the dataset extraction and splitting, together with model pre-training, finetuning and the training of the reinforcement learning models. 
All the source code will be released upon consideration for review of the current submission.
